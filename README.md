## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

At Binghamton University, I'm navigating through a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics, anticipating graduation in May 2025. This academic journey complements my position as a Player Participation Data Collector at PFF, where I harness data collection skills by meticulously analyzing college football gameplay. My education, professional pursuits, and passion coalesce, propelling me toward a future in sports data analytics.

In my other current position as an assistant at National Insurance Brokerage of New York, I have been introduced to professionalism and what it takes to be a successful worker. Starting as a summer intern in 2023, with continuous hard work and dedication to detail, I have worked my way up to a full time assistant in between school semesters and a part time remote position during the semester.
